## Future Ideas

### This section may need [it's own page!](docs/future_plans.md)

I'm documenting some of my future feature ideas for this project as they happen.

In order to avoid the "Scope Creep" it's comforting to have somewhere easliy accessible to make these notes for future reference!

If you have any ideas and want to talk, please do [get in touch!](https://ljblogs-fcdcaa00fdda.herokuapp.com/about/). I can't wait to hear from you!

Here is my [future ideas page](docs/future_plans.md)
