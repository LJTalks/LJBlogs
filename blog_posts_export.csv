Battling Bots: How We’re Keeping LJTalks Safe Without Blocking Legit Members,battling-bots-how-were-keeping-ljtalks-safe-without-blocking-legit-members,ljtalks,https://res.cloudinary.com/dcvata7jw/image/upload/v1729537833/yyurwrxb4kt16t1sww4k.jpg,Photo by Tima Miroshnichenko: https://www.pexels.com/photo/people-hacking-a-computer-system-5380649/,Tima Miroshnichenko,"<p><strong>In the world of web development, there’s one thing we all dread—bots.</strong> As I’ve been building and refining my website, I’ve been doing my best to make sure it’s a great space for legitimate users to interact, subscribe, and join my community. But over the past few days, I’ve faced an unexpected (but interesting!) challenge: keeping bots at bay.</p><h3>How Did the Bots Get In?</h3><p>It all started when I noticed some suspicious registrations. While I was doing my regular tests, I began seeing odd accounts—users who signed up but had names that looked more like random characters than actual people. No email verification, no logins, and yet they kept coming!</p><p>This is a common problem across the web: bots make up around 42.3% of internet traffic, with malicious bots accounting for 27.7%, according to <a rel=""noopener"" target=""_new"">Imperva’s 2023 Bad Bot Report</a>. Of course, bots registering for your site isn’t just annoying. They’re potentially harmful, slowing down your server or even paving the way for spammy content. So, I knew I needed to take action—but how do you fight back against the bots without pushing away legitimate users?</p><h3>Step 1: Honeypots and reCAPTCHA</h3><p>The first step I took was adding honeypots to both the contact form and the registration form. Honeypots are hidden fields that only bots (and not real users) will fill out. If a bot tries to fill out the hidden fields, I catch it and silently deny the registration.</p><p>Next up was reCAPTCHA. I experimented with versions that weren’t too intrusive for users but still effective at blocking bot submissions. With this combination in place, things started improving. Now, the honeypot system catches over 90% of bots attempting to register, while legitimate users aren’t even aware that extra measures are in place.</p><h3>Step 2: Rate Limiting</h3><p>Once the honeypots and reCAPTCHA were up and running, I introduced rate limiting to the user registration form. Rate limiting allows us to restrict how many requests any user or IP address can make within a short period of time. If a bot tries to hit the signup form with multiple requests per second (or even per minute), they get blocked automatically.</p><p>This was a major step forward. By blocking suspicious activity early on, we cut down bot-generated spam by nearly 80%.</p><h3>Step 3: Tracking Sources and IPs</h3><p>One of the more interesting steps I’ve taken is tracking where users are coming from. For every registration attempt, I now capture the referrer URL (where the user came from) and the IP address. If a new user is legitimate, great! If not, I can check the source and see if there’s a pattern to where these bots are coming from.</p><p>This simple tracking gave me more visibility into what’s happening behind the scenes. Bots from suspicious referrers and IP addresses are now quickly identified and blocked, further improving the site’s security.</p><h3>The Balance: Keeping Legit Users Happy</h3><p>Of course, all these defenses have to come with a balance. I don’t want to annoy legitimate users with endless captchas or have them blocked because of rate-limiting. So, I’ve made sure to fine-tune everything to be as user-friendly as possible.</p><p>That’s where the rate-limiting comes in handy—it’s set high enough that regular users shouldn’t ever feel it, but bots trying to hit the site hard get caught. Similarly, honeypots work behind the scenes, so real users won’t even know they exist.</p><h3>Lessons Learned</h3><p>At first, dealing with bots was annoying—just another distraction from getting the fun parts of the site up and running. But as I dove deeper, it became a really interesting challenge! It’s not just about stopping bad actors but about finding the right balance between security and usability.</p><p>Here are a few takeaways:</p><ol><li><strong>Always track user activity</strong>: Knowing where sign-ups are coming from (referrer and IP) gives you visibility into who might be legitimate and who’s a potential bot.</li><li><strong>Layer your defenses</strong>: Combining reCAPTCHA, honeypots, and rate-limiting gives you multiple lines of protection.</li><li><strong>Keep user experience in mind</strong>: Your real users should never feel like they’re jumping through hoops to sign up. Everything needs to work seamlessly for them, while still keeping the bots out.</li></ol><p>And that’s the story of how I’m keeping LJTalks safe while welcoming legit members. If you’re building your own project and finding yourself in a similar spot—don’t worry. There are plenty of tools to fight back against bots, and once you understand the tricks, it can even be kind of fun!</p><h3>Tracking: Why It’s About Security, Not Spying</h3><p>Let’s talk about tracking. It’s a word that tends to raise eyebrows, and I completely get it. In today’s world, privacy concerns are everywhere. Many of us are suspicious when we hear that websites are “tracking” something about us, and that’s completely understandable. But I want to be clear about what we’re doing and why we’re doing it.</p><p>For LJTalks, tracking user activity—like capturing the referrer URL and IP address when someone registers—has one main goal: <strong>security</strong>. It’s all about making sure that the people joining the community are real, legitimate users, not bots or bad actors trying to mess with the site.</p><h4>Why Do We Track Referrers and IPs?</h4><p>When someone signs up, I capture:</p><ul><li><strong>Referrer URL</strong>: This tells me where the person came from—whether it’s a social media post, a Google search, or another website. If I see suspicious patterns, like users coming from odd or untrustworthy sources, it gives me a clue that they might be bots.</li><li><strong>IP Address</strong>: This is another useful piece of information. Bots often use fake or unusual IP addresses, so tracking IPs helps me catch them before they can cause trouble.</li></ul><p>That’s it. I’m not interested in where you go after you leave the site or anything invasive like that. I only track what’s necessary to keep the site safe and make sure that real people—people like you—are protected.</p><h4>What Does This Mean for Legitimate Users?</h4><p>For legitimate users, this tracking actually improves your experience. By keeping bots and spam out, I can focus on creating a community that’s safe, welcoming, and free from the annoyances that often plague other sites. It helps keep things running smoothly, ensuring the website remains responsive and functional for everyone who wants to join and interact.</p><p>It’s a balancing act, though. I’m committed to doing the bare minimum necessary to ensure the site’s security and to protect your privacy. I don’t want to track more than I need to—just enough to keep the bad actors away and the good ones engaged.</p><h4>Why You Shouldn't Worry</h4><p>When people think of “tracking,” they often picture invasive surveillance or companies selling their data to advertisers. But that's not the kind of tracking I’m talking about here. My focus is solely on protecting your experience and making the site better for everyone.</p><p>Here’s what I’m <strong>not</strong> doing:</p><ul><li>I’m not selling your data.</li><li>I’m not tracking your browsing habits outside of LJTalks.</li><li>I’m not storing unnecessary personal details about you.</li></ul><p>Instead, I’m using this information to identify unusual behavior—like bots registering in bulk—and prevent those patterns from disrupting the experience for legitimate users.</p><h3>Transparency and Your Trust</h3><p>At the end of the day, I want you to know that <strong>your trust is my priority</strong>. I’m being upfront about what I’m doing because I believe that’s the right thing to do. If you ever have concerns or questions about how I handle security and privacy, I’m always open to discussing it. My tracking efforts are entirely in service of creating a better, safer community for real people, and nothing more.</p><h3>Facing Similar Issues?</h3><p>Are you dealing with bots too? <a rel=""noopener"" href=""#"">Subscribe to LJTalks</a> for more tips and insights on securing your website and creating a safe online community!</p>",,2024-10-21 19:06:32.038548+00:00,2024-10-26 13:12:26.023893+00:00,1,2024-10-21 19:05:28+00:00,anotherlaura,21,"website bot protection, stop bots on website, prevent bot registrations, website security measures, rate limiting to prevent bots, honeypot fields in forms, reCAPTCHA vs bots, tracking referrer URL for security, IP tracking to block bots, improve website security, user privacy and security balance, ethical user tracking, transparency in online tracking, safe website community building, protect legitimate users online, online form security best practices, stopping bot traffic on websites, security measures for user signups, blocking fake registrations, balancing user experience with security","Learn how LJTalks stops bots and secures legitimate users with rate limiting, honeypots, and tracking to prevent fake registrations and improve website security"

"Morning Thoughts: Gratitude, Websites, and the Affiliate Journey",morning-thoughts-gratitude-websites-and-the-affiliate-journey,ljtalks,https://res.cloudinary.com/dcvata7jw/image/upload/placeholder,,,"<p><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">When I wake up in the morning, before I even get out of bed, I like to lie still for a few moments and try to be grateful, even though my brain is usually spinning with all the things I have to do. Right now, it's intense. Here I am, building my own website from scratch. Sure, I couldn’t do it without Django, Python, and a little bit of JavaScript here and there, but it's </span><em><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">mine</span></em><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 18px;""><br></span><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">And I have to give credit where it’s due—ChatGPT has been an unexpected companion in all of this. I’d be feeling really isolated and overwhelmed without it. He's like that friend who's always there to help, even if sometimes he gets a little too confident (seriously, who knew there were so many types of reCAPTCHA?). You know that friend who’s all, ""Yeah, we got this!"" and then you end up in some tricky situations? Yeah, that’s ChatGPT. But he's gotten me out of plenty of jams, too.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 18px;""><br></span><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">So this morning, I was thinking about how to monetize the site. In the last 18 months, I’ve picked up so many new tools and software packages—some have been great, some... meh. And the thing is, almost all of them offer affiliate programs. For those who don’t know, affiliate marketing means that if I tell you how much I love a product and you decide to try it out, I get compensated for recommending it. It’s not new. Affiliate programs have been around almost as long as the internet. Before that, it was in magazines, TV shows, all sorts of places.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 18px;""><br></span><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">Some people don't love affiliate links, and I get it. But if you're okay with ads on YouTube or TV, it's not all that different. Except here, the content is relevant to what you're already interested in—and, bonus, you might actually find something valuable</span>!</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 24px;"">Why Custom Websites?</span><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">Aside from affiliate marketing, I’m also hoping people will realize how useful a custom-built website can be. Sure, there are plenty of services out there to help you run a business, but what if you don’t want 50 tabs open at any given moment? What if you want something that does </span><em><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">exactly</span></em><span style=""font-size: 18px;""> what you need it to do? That’s who I’m hoping to reach.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 18px;""><br></span><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">I’m not trying to build the next Skool (or insert other big website here) - I’m more curious to see if I </span><em><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">can</span></em><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">. There are so many quirky little things you learn along the way, like handling bots and reCAPTCHA, things I wouldn’t have even thought about before. But it’s all part of the process, and honestly, it's kind of fun in a weird way.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">Yesterday, I was listening to an interview with one of the co-founders of Ghost, the open-source blogging platform. It’s non-profit, built to rival the likes of WordPress, and it’s really impressive. If I wasn’t building my own blog, Ghost would definitely be my next stop.</span></p><h3>The Subscription Economy</h3><p><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">These days, everyone is chasing subscriptions. You build a product once, and people will pay for it over and over again. It’s not a new concept - music and movies have worked this way forever. No one complains about musicians getting royalties (well... maybe a little), but people deserve to be compensated for their work.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">I don’t know if this website will make me much money. Maybe a little from affiliate marketing, but that’s not the point. Yes, I need to make money - none of us can live off fresh air, and I’ve got three teenagers with never-ending appetites. But this project is also about seeing if I can </span><em><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">do</span></em><span style=""font-size: 18px;""> it. Can I build the site I want, without cutting corners? Because if I can do it for myself, then I can do it for others too. And there's something really satisfying about seeing it all come together exactly the way I envisioned.</span></p><h3>The Battle with Bots</h3><p><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">Today, I’ll continue the battle with reCAPTCHA. It's not something I thought I’d care about much. Those annoying little “Are you human?” things can feel dumb at times. But when your half-finished site gets 30 new “subscribers” overnight with names like ""hgflXUIY"" or ""kjhgaui,"" plus a spammy casino ad in your inbox... well, you start to take that stuff a bit more seriously.</span></p>",,2024-10-20 11:04:35.398992+00:00,2024-10-20 22:56:01.387909+00:00,0,2024-10-20 11:04:31+00:00,,0,,

Just me, my code, and the peaceful hum of my fan.</span><br></h3><p>Then BAM! Out of nowhere, people start finding my site. <b>Actual people</b>. Clicking on things. Signing up for stuff. Even sending me spammy casino ads through my contact form! 😳</p><p>I mean, what?! Who are you? How did you find me?

How hard could it be?”</em><br></h2><p><span style=""font-weight: 700;"">Spoiler alert: Two. Days. Later.</span></p><p>It turns out, building an email system is kind of like chasing your own tail. You can’t stop, you can’t win (at least not without several rounds of coffee), but you’re pretty sure you’re getting somewhere. Maybe.</p><h3 style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"">The Unfolding Saga</h3><p>It started off as an innocent idea:&nbsp;<em>""I’ll just add a form, sprinkle in some checkboxes, do some backend validation, and voilà—custom email system!""</em>&nbsp;What followed was a lesson in both humility and patience, as well as a deep dive into the wonderful world of modals, checkboxes, and the mysterious art of CSRF tokens.</p><h4 style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"">The Checkbox Chronicles</h4><p>There’s something oddly satisfying about a checkbox... until you realize that unchecked boxes might as well be unchecked emotions. Are users unsubscribing, or are they just confused? The real kicker was getting everything to work in tandem without causing the form to break down in tears—like I almost did.</p><h4 style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"">Modal Madness</h4><p>Let’s talk modals. These little pop-up windows of joy are there to make sure users are&nbsp;<em>really, *really*</em>&nbsp;sure they want to unsubscribe. But after testing my modal 30 times (not that I’m counting), it started to feel like an endless loop of uncertainty. Click unsubscribe, reload the page, nothing happens. Did it work? Maybe the modal is stuck in existential limbo... along with my sanity.</p><h4 style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"">The Double Opt-In Dilemma</h4><p>Double opt-in - good for users, bad for developers who enjoy their weekends. Do I send a confirmation when they subscribe? What about when they unsubscribe? Oh wait, they changed their mind. Quick, send them three more emails to make sure we’re all on the same page.</p><h4 style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"">Validation, Schmalidation</h4><p>I’d like to think I’m a validation pro.

You write your code, preview your page, and boom—nothing looks the way it should. It’s as if your carefully constructed layout turned into a Picasso painting overnight. Welcome to the world of web design.</p><h3 style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 500; line-height: 1.2; font-size: 1.75rem;"">1. The “Why Is My Button Floating in Space?” Dilemma</h3><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem;"">You add a button. It’s supposed to sit perfectly in the middle of your form. But when you refresh the page, your button is out there… floating… like an astronaut who’s just disconnected from the spaceship. It's an existential crisis, both for you and the button. But you keep going.</p><h3 style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 500; line-height: 1.2; font-size: 1.75rem;"">2.<span>&nbsp;</span><code style=""box-sizing: border-box; font-family: var(--bs-font-monospace); font-size: 0.875em; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: bidi-override; color: rgb(214, 51, 132); overflow-wrap: break-word;"">display: none;</code>—The Magic Trick We All Need</h3><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem;"">CSS gives us this nifty little trick to make elements disappear from the page. Want to hide that annoying header that’s messing up your design?<span>&nbsp;</span><code style=""box-sizing: border-box; font-family: var(--bs-font-monospace); font-size: 0.875em; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: bidi-override; color: rgb(214, 51, 132); overflow-wrap: break-word;"">display: none;</code><span>&nbsp;</span>Boom! It’s like the magician’s disappearing act. Until… you can’t figure out how to make it reappear, and now you’re Googling how to undo your own magic. Ah, the joys of CSS.</p><h3 style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 500; line-height: 1.2; font-size: 1.75rem;"">3. Flexbox—The Answer to All Your Problems (Until It Isn’t)</h3><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem;"">Flexbox! The hero we deserve and the layout saviour we need. It promises to solve all your alignment issues. You throw a flex container at your page, sit back, and wait for the magic to happen. But instead of nicely aligned boxes, your divs are playing a game of tag across the screen, and your layout looks like a puzzle where none of the pieces fit. Flexbox: saving the day one misaligned div at a time.</p><h3 style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 500; line-height: 1.2; font-size: 1.75rem;"">4. CSS Grid: Flexbox’s Big Brother</h3><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem;"">If Flexbox isn’t working, surely CSS Grid will! Right? Right?? Well, Grid steps in like an overconfident older sibling who knows exactly what’s up. You lay out your grid containers, you set your columns and rows, and then... it’s a mess. Rows are overflowing, columns are squished, and once again, you're scratching your head wondering where it all went wrong.</p><h3 style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 500; line-height: 1.2; font-size: 1.75rem;"">5. Z-Index Wars: Who Rises to the Top?</h3><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem;"">Z-index, you tricky little devil. You’ve got a few elements layered on top of each other, and suddenly, the element that should be on top is hiding underneath everything else. You set the z-index to a million, and still… it refuses to show up. It’s basically the hide-and-seek champion of your website.</p><h3 style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 500; line-height: 1.2; font-size: 1.75rem;"">6. The Final Straw: Box Shadow Shenanigans</h3><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem;"">You think, “Let’s add a little drop shadow for that<span>&nbsp;</span><em style=""box-sizing: border-box;"">wow</em><span>&nbsp;</span>factor.” Seems easy, right? Well, somehow, your drop shadow looks like a glowing radioactive orb around your button. Congratulations, you’ve turned your website into a scene from a sci-fi movie. This is the moment you push your chair back, sigh, and seriously contemplate a career change.</p><h3 style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 500; line-height: 1.2; font-size: 1.75rem;"">7. But Then, It Clicks</h3><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem;"">After hours of trial and error, you suddenly stumble upon the magic combination of CSS properties. The layout looks<span>&nbsp;</span><em style=""box-sizing: border-box;"">just</em><span>&nbsp;</span>right. The colours are perfect. The button is exactly where it should be. And for that fleeting moment, you feel like a coding god.</p><h3 style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 500; line-height: 1.2; font-size: 1.75rem;"">8. Until Tomorrow...</h3><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem;"">But of course, tomorrow you’ll open your site on another browser, and everything will be broken again. Because if there’s one universal truth about web development, it’s this: CSS giveth, and CSS taketh away.</p><hr style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1rem 0px; color: inherit; background-color: currentcolor; border: 0px; opacity: 0.25; height: 1px;""><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem;""><strong style=""box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bolder;"">Conclusion:</strong><br style=""box-sizing: border-box;"">So, if you’re ever feeling lost in the tangled world of CSS, remember—you’re not alone. Somewhere out there, another coder is crying over a misaligned button. But that’s okay, because after every meltdown, comes that sweet victory of a perfectly styled page (for now). Keep going. The web needs your design skills, and so do all of us who still can't centre a div.</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem;""></p></div></div></div>",,2024-10-17 00:04:00.632683+00:00,2024-10-17 00:04:00.632697+00:00,0,2024-10-03 18:00:00+00:00,,0,,

I hesitated because I’ve never really identified as one. I’m no graphic designer, and genuinely rely on google to let me know what colours and contrasts work together. But lately, I’ve been thinking about how coding is helping me solve problems creatively. Creativity is *not* just about making things look pretty or adding fancy features; it’s more about thinking, “Can we automate that?” and finding solutions to make life easier for others, solving real world problems.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 1rem; color: rgb(33, 37, 41); font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, &quot;Liberation Sans&quot;, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(249, 250, 252);""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 1rem; color: rgb(33, 37, 41); font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, &quot;Liberation Sans&quot;, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(249, 250, 252);"">I’m starting to see that creativity and problem-solving are two sides of the same coin.

This was supposed to be simple! Are you sure you know what you’re doing? Maybe it’s time to start again...”</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem;""><em style=""box-sizing: border-box;""><b style=""box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bolder;"">Cue dramatic pause.</b></em></p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem;"">But no! I won’t fall for it. I know this feeling. It’s the same one that pops up when you’re halfway through building IKEA furniture and realize there’s a part that looks suspiciously important lying on the floor. You’ve got the pieces, you’ve got the instructions (sort of), and you’re pretty sure it’ll all come together. Eventually.</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem;"">Then it hit me: You don’t wait until the IKEA wardrobe is fully built to admire your progress, right? You take breaks after each step, maybe snap a pic to show off those slightly wobbly but upright panels, and move on. Maybe it should be the same with coding?</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem;"">I’ve developed a habit of making regular commits, usually after I’ve added a small feature that works without breaking anything else. It just made sense at the time, but this project? This beast is different. “There are so many moving parts” has become my new mantra these past few days.</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem;"">I don’t need perfection.

I’ll save the “final reveal” for when everything is polished, but for now, I’m just happy to still know which way is up in the code jungle. And honestly, why didn’t I think of this sooner?</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem;"">I’ll be chatting with my team later, and I’m sure their advice will be the usual: breathe, commit, grab another coffee.

Oh no, this was an ERD of epic proportions—like a cat sitting on your keyboard, deliberately pressing random keys and&nbsp;<em>daring</em>&nbsp;you to stop it. One minute I was confidently dragging lines between my User model and Blog post, and the next… those lines had minds of their own, darting across the screen like a hyperactive kitten chasing a laser pointer.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 1rem; color: rgb(33, 37, 41); font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, &quot;Liberation Sans&quot;, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(249, 250, 252);"">Many-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many—did I even know what these terms meant anymore? For a while, it felt like all those ""ones"" and ""manys"" were conspiring against me, like a group of cats knocking things off tables just to see what happens. And let’s not even talk about how many times I had to undo my perfectly placed boxes just because a line decided it didn’t like where it was heading! (Thanks again, imaginary cat.)</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 1rem; color: rgb(33, 37, 41); font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, &quot;Liberation Sans&quot;, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(249, 250, 252);"">Just as I was about to throw in the towel—or possibly my laptop—things started to click. It wasn’t just about drawing lines and placing boxes, no! This was about&nbsp;<span style=""font-weight: bolder;"">understanding&nbsp;<em>relationships</em></span>. It was like trying to convince a cat that the laser pointer wasn’t out to get them. It was about realizing that a User could comment on multiple Blogs, but each Comment only had one User. It was about knowing that each Product was part of a bigger system, interacting with Purchases, Comments, and Blogs, all while your metaphorical cat knocked over yet another carefully stacked diagram box.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 1rem; color: rgb(33, 37, 41); font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, &quot;Liberation Sans&quot;, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(249, 250, 252);"">The lesson? Just like a stubborn cat that won't stop sitting on your keyboard, sometimes you need to let the chaos happen before the things start making sense. Eraser.io may have been my battleground today, but in the end, I tamed the wild beast (and the metaphorical cat). Once I truly understood those connections, the lines between the boxes stopped running wild and started falling into place—like a kitten finally giving up and curling into your lap.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 1rem; color: rgb(33, 37, 41); font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, &quot;Liberation Sans&quot;, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(249, 250, 252);"">And let's not forget the comedic moments: that time when half the lines overlapped, and I genuinely thought I’d invented a new form of abstract art, or when I learned what a ""clob"" was (no, not the sound you make when you drop your phone, though it should be). In this whole mess, I started wondering if my ERD diagram had secretly become a cat toy—entertaining for the cat but utterly confusing for me.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 1rem; color: rgb(33, 37, 41); font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, &quot;Liberation Sans&quot;, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(249, 250, 252);"">By the end of the day, what started as chaos became clarity. I now have an ERD that makes sense, and I can proudly say that the one-to-manys and many-to-ones no longer terrify me. (I can't say the same for actual cats though—those little guys are unpredictable.)</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 1rem; color: rgb(33, 37, 41); font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, &quot;Liberation Sans&quot;, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(249, 250, 252);"">Lesson of the day: The only way to master an ERD (or a mischievous cat) is to let it be messy for a while. Let the lines run amok, let the boxes overlap—because in the end, it’s all part of the process. Eventually, everything will fall into place, and you’ll be left with a masterpiece (or at least something that looks less like abstract art and more like a diagram).</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 1rem; color: rgb(33, 37, 41); font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, &quot;Liberation Sans&quot;, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(249, 250, 252);"">Stay tuned for tomorrow's blog post, where I’ll inevitably find myself in yet another database dilemma.

From basic HTML structures to building full-stack web applications, this experience has been anything but predictable. It’s been a whirlwind of learning, late nights, and “aha!” moments, with a healthy dose of self-doubt thrown in for good measure. And here we are—three hours to go, and I’m questioning my entire existence! 😅</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem;"">But isn’t that just the beauty of growth? It’s messy, chaotic, and sometimes downright confusing, but it’s also exhilarating. What started as a quest to learn a new skill has turned into something much bigger—a complete transformation in how I see myself, my abilities, and my future. I’m not just learning to code; I’m learning to believe in myself and trust the process.</p><h3 style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 500; line-height: 1.2; font-size: 1.75rem;"">Lessons in the Madness</h3><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem;"">One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned during this journey is the importance of embracing the unknown. When I first started, I was hyper-focused on getting everything “right.” Every bug felt like a personal failure, and every new concept felt overwhelming. But somewhere along the way, I realized that it’s okay not to have all the answers. In fact, the magic often happens when you lean into that discomfort and let yourself figure it out along the way.</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem;"">This final project has been the ultimate test of that mindset. Between building a booking system, integrating user feedback, and getting my notes app to behave (eventually!), there have been plenty of moments where I could have thrown in the towel. But instead, I embraced the chaos, tackled one issue at a time, and came out stronger on the other side.</p><h3 style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 500; line-height: 1.2; font-size: 1.75rem;"">Building Something That Matters</h3><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem;"">More than just writing code, this project has been about building something meaningful. The website I’m creating isn’t just another portfolio piece—it’s a hub for growth, learning, and connection. My goal has always been to create a space where people can discover their strengths, find their voice, and ultimately, build something amazing for themselves. And that vision is what’s kept me going through the tough moments.</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem;"">I’m a firm believer that everyone has a story worth sharing, and that includes the challenges. Whether you’re building a business, learning a new skill, or just trying to figure out what’s next in life, the bumps in the road are part of what makes the journey worthwhile. And hey, if I can wrestle with JavaScript functions at 2am and live to tell the tale, so can you!</p><h3 style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 500; line-height: 1.2; font-size: 1.75rem;"">What’s Next?</h3><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem;"">As the final hours of this project tick by, I’m both nervous and excited for what’s next. This website is just the beginning—a stepping stone toward bigger things. In the coming weeks, I’ll be launching new services, resources, and courses designed to help people tap into their potential and start building a life they love.</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem;"">But for now, I’m focused on finishing this sprint, tying up loose ends, and (hopefully!) getting some well-deserved rest. If there’s one thing I’ve learned through this journey, it’s that growth doesn’t always look the way you expect. Sometimes it’s messy and stressful, but in the end, it’s always worth it.</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem;"">So here’s to the final push, the chaos of deadlines, and the excitement of what’s to come. Let’s keep growing, learning, and building together!</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem;""><br style=""box-sizing: border-box;""></p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem;"">#GrowthMindset #WebDevelopment #BuildingTheFuture #TechJourney<br style=""box-sizing: border-box;""></p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem;""></p></div></div></div>",,2024-10-16 23:54:50.527782+00:00,2024-10-16 23:54:50.527800+00:00,0,2024-10-04 12:00:00+00:00,,0,,

A walkthrough&nbsp; tutorial.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>I've created a test app in Heroku before. I'm so keen to get onto his part because it's where I learn to make the blog for real!&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>So Heroku and my Gitpod is all fine, I figured that bit out, but I can't get Heroku and Gitpod to speak to each other. It's something to do with my login. I suspect it might be something as simple as that I'm logged into the wrong google account so it's not authorising me? I've had api keys form Heroku, nope, I have multifactor auth set up so that won't work. Round and round.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Is it because I tried to reuse my first app in Heroku (I heard a whisper about having a max of 8, does that mean I can only have 8 in total so I can just delete old ones? Or 8 is the limit, deletions won't help?</p><p><br></p><p>So I realised over the last couple of days I don't really understand programming/coding at all. I've been listening to tutorials in my headphones round the house hoping some of the language/terms etc will absorb into me. And now I realise, I don't understand ports, terminals, what exactly is the command line? There are shells and environments and this is what I need to get to grips with?&nbsp;</p><p>I need&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>But this is the first time I've had to get H</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Half of the problem when you have a problem is being able to explain the [problem well in a way that other people can understand it.

Django. 🤯</p><p><br></p><p>It feelsl ke cheating 😂&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Having spen weeks tryingto arrange my blog, and realising that it was probably wasted time, I'm now really va=luing that time I ""wasted"" trying to come up with workarounds to make my site do what I wanted it to.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>I have learned so much that I would have just ""missedout on"" had I gone straight to Django (I really wanted to skip ahead in the course; I had to try *really hard* to restrain myself 😂)</p><p><br></p><p>Week 11 day 5.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Boom! I am a full stack developer! Welcome to my first full stack web application! I did it!&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>I'm not done on the course yet, and I know that now the learning really begins.

"Project Submitted: I Wasn't Ready, But Here We Are",project-submitted-i-wasnt-ready-but-here-we-are,ljtalks,https://res.cloudinary.com/dcvata7jw/image/upload/v1729387920/nv02ifkilbuglvfvhgw8.jpg,,,"<p>So, the project is in. Submitted. And guess what? I wasn't ready. Not even close. I was <em>implicitly</em> advised not to look back. Just move on, they said. What’s done is done, they said.<br></p><p>But, you know me—of course, I looked back.</p><p>I was reflecting on the final rule of Code Club: delete all commented-out code. Clean is king, right? No rogue lines, no unnecessary clutter. Cool, I can handle that. But then it hit me like a rogue semicolon—wait… did I miss something? I wouldn’t have forgotten that. Right? Who even <em>puts</em> emojis in their comments? 👀</p><p>And yet… it kept nagging at me, buzzing around my brain like a bug in an endless loop. Did I, in a moment of pure post-debugging delirium, actually leave a crying-laugh emoji in my code? 😂</p><p>I woke up with one of those massive “HUUUH” gasps. The kind where your whole body decides it’s time to panic before you’ve even opened your eyes.</p><p>Did I seriously leave an emoji in my code? 🙈</p><p>I mean, if I failed because of a rogue emoji, that’s got to be some kind of unique achievement, right? How many Code Institute students can say <em>that</em> was their downfall?</p><p>But looking back, it’s not just about an emoji (though I’ll be looking for it—trust me). What I <em>really</em> found was a reminder of how deep this journey took me. I gave everything I had to this course. Blood, sweat, tears, and possibly a few giggles at inappropriate times. And in return? Well, it gave me <em>stuff</em> in absolute spades. Lessons, growth, headaches—yes—but also victories, big and small. And hopefully, my kids will see the benefit of it all when they realize I’ve been steering this ship like a slightly unhinged pirate, but a pirate with <em>intent.</em></p><p>Sure, there’s always a little threat of doom on the horizon, but you know what? I don’t believe in that anymore. I don’t have room for wolves peeking around doors. Desperate people do desperate things—that's something I heard right before I started this course. It hit home then, but now? Nah. No more.</p><p>This opportunity didn’t find me because I was desperate. It found me because I was <em>curious.</em> Could I have paid someone to build me a blog? Sure. But where’s the fun in that? I would’ve torn it apart until I understood it better than they did anyway. 😂</p><p>I’ll always be grateful to Code Institute (and Facebook ads) for finding me and throwing me into this wild world of coding. I <em>know</em> things are going to be okay. One of my excellent tutors summed it up perfectly: “You’re literally insane. What you’ve achieved is utterly bonkers.” Okay, fine, that’s not exactly what he said, but he’s definitely said stuff like that enough times that I’m confident he meant it.</p><p>For those of us who’ve made it this far, we’re legends. We gave it everything we had, and we had the most insane support along the way—people who kept our spirits up while making sure we had no illusions about what we’d signed up for. No pedestals, but wowzers—I needed this.</p><p>I know things will never be the same again.</p><p>And I’m <em>still</em> looking for that emoji. Maybe it’ll give the assessor a giggle. Honestly, I know I probably didn’t take the docs seriously enough. I know I know I know. And that’s okay. Because an easy win wouldn’t have led me here tonight, celebrating this epic fail in the way I’ve learned to over the last few months.</p><p>When people talk about epic fails, I don’t think they fully appreciate how <strong>epic</strong> failure can actually be. I do now.</p><p>And guess what? I’m almost ready for my comeback. I’m done hiding. I <em>know</em> I can help others—even if they just see me and think, “Wow, she literally wouldn’t look up or speak last time I saw her.” I’m here to show people there are options. Possibilities. We all have something inside us, something full of value, just waiting to be shared.</p><p>Recently, I had a revelation about sharing. Keeping your value hidden? That’s selfish. We <em>all</em> have a gift. Find out what it is and share it with the world. That’s what I’m doing now—holding the faith, buckling down hard, because this just <em>has</em> to work. No other option.</p>",,2024-10-16 23:19:40.096186+00:00,2024-10-25 06:08:03.293163+00:00,1,2024-10-04 18:00:00+00:00,anotherlaura,14,,

Instead of trying to create a fully-fledged beast from the start, I’m taking it step by step—getting the basics working first, then adding what’s needed as we go.

That’s why getting feedback early on is so important. My vision for LJ Reach is big, but I don’t want to assume I know everything about what’s needed. That’s where people like Peter (or whoever steps up!) come in.

I had my coffee in hand, a decent night's sleep (more or less), and a head full of ideas. I was ready to nail down this whole project like it was no big deal.</span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;""><span style=""font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"">Step 1: The ER Diagram. You know, that thing that looks all neat and tidy on paper but secretly lurks around corners waiting to smack you in the face with a </span><span style=""font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:700;font-style:italic;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"">“Did you really think this was gonna be easy?”</span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;""><span style=""font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"">So there I am, mapping out Users and Bookings with all the confidence of a professional diagrammer (yep, I made up that word). “Users will book services, and they’ll also buy digital products,” I thought, “Easy peasy.” Except, plot twist — in walks the realization that webinars, mentoring, PDFs, and online courses might just belong to totally different worlds. Like, wait a minute — are webinars services or products? Do mentoring sessions need their own booking system? Should I just throw the whole thing out the window and start again? 🤔</span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;""><span style=""font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"">Step 2: Panic. For a brief moment, I questioned my entire existence. But then I had an epiphany: KEEP IT SIMPLE. Yes, simplicity — the holy grail of getting an MVP done without losing your mind. So, after a quick chat with my tutor (who, might I add, probably heard the panic in my voice from a mile away), we agreed: we’re keeping Products for now and saving the complicated service stuff for later. Future me can deal with that mess.</span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;""><span style=""font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"">Step 3: Blogging about it. Then it hit me. This whole process of planning, scrapping ideas, re-planning, and talking myself down from the ledge is exactly the kind of thing people love to read about. Why not blog about every twist and turn? After all, if I’m learning at breakneck speed, surely others will find it useful. Plus, it’ll be fun to look back on all the chaos, right?</span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;""><span style=""font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"">Moral of the story: Today’s big win was realizing that less is more (at least for now), and I’m just going to focus on making things functional. No more chasing my own tail trying to figure out if my webinars belong in the service app or the product app. They can stay in the product app, and I’ll sleep soundly tonight knowing I haven’t created a booking system that looks like spaghetti.</span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;""><span style=""font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"">So here we are, at the end of the day. The ER Diagram has been updated, my sanity has been restored (mostly), and I’ve learned that keeping it simple might just be the key to success.

Sounds simple, right? But with security alerts, outdated dependencies, and version mismatches, it’s easy for even the most confident dev to feel like they’re swimming upstream. While the GitHub Dependabot kept flagging potential vulnerabilities, Heroku threw in its share of 500 errors just to keep things interesting.</span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;""><span style=""font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"">The truth is, these obstacles are par for the course, especially when working on live applications.

Developers are, in a way, modern polymaths, especially in the full-stack world. We code, we design, we troubleshoot, and we even think about security and server management. Being “T-shaped” means we’re not just good at everything; we specialize in particular areas, whether front-end, back-end, or dev-ops. The trick is to embrace this complexity and see it as the adventure it is, rather than an overwhelming mess.</span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;""><span style=""font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"">When to Call It a Night</span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;""><span style=""font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"">After hours of chasing 500 errors, tweaking configurations, and double-checking migrations, there comes a point where the best course of action is to step back.

Or at least, that was the plan. But then, as soon as my fingers hit the keyboard the excitement builds; Dynamic pricing!

Fun, but overwhelming!</span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;""><span style=""font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"">I had a chat with my cohort leader, who showed me some mind-blowing tricks I could integrate into my project. I don’t think he realized that I’m never short on ideas—I’m a walking brainstorm! His suggestions were incredible, and even though we talked about how he had to learn to reign his ideas in and really commit to the planning stage, and I agreed, but somehow his project inspired me to think bigger and really see how my simple site had all the hallmarks and potential of becoming an actual full-on e-commerce site, something I really didn’t envision when I started.</span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;""><span style=""font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"">I’ve been pondering on a question he asked me; did I see myself as a creative person? I hesitated because I’ve never really identified as one. I’m no graphic designer, and genuinely rely on google to let me know what colours and contrasts work together. But lately, I’ve been thinking about how coding is helping me solve problems creatively. It’s not just about making things look pretty or adding fancy features; it’s more about thinking, “Can we automate that?” and finding solutions to make life easier for others, solving real world problems.</span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;""><span style=""font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"">I’m starting to see that creativity and problem-solving are two sides of the same coin. Whether it’s a messy code base or a real-world issue, creativity helps us find new ways to tackle challenges.

And, for a moment, I thought, <em>this <b>might </b>actually work.</em><br></p><p>But let’s rewind a bit.</p><p>The journey to that moment wasn’t smooth (is it ever?). In fact, it was a day packed with problem-solving, almost <b>comical oversights</b>, and <b>mini-victories</b>. </p><p>First, we tackled something that has been in the pipeline for a while: attaching my <b>custom domain </b>to the live site. <b>Big moment! </b>That URL, which I’ve been keeping in my back pocket, was finally <strong>live</strong> for the world to see.</p><p>But wait, there’s more... We went headfirst into preparing a <b>help sheet </b>to make it easier for others to do the same. Not that we got too far with that before getting <b>distracted </b>with a myriad of other site details (more on that later). Let’s just say that <b>list of “small things” </b>was far from small.</p><p>A couple of <b>amazing </b>testers are now waiting in the wings to get their hands on the site. Which is both exhilarating and terrifying. Will they love it? Will they find <b><em>even more</em> edge cases </b>that I somehow missed? </p><p>I’ve become a bit obsessed with <b>imagining every possible scenario that could go wrong </b>(it's a bit of a quirk). Edge cases that may only happen once in a blue moon... but you bet I’m tracking them down.</p><p>We made some solid updates to the site, though. One of my favourites? The <b>404 error page</b>. Yes, I’m excited about an error page. But this one isn’t your standard, boring “page not found.” It’s fun, cheeky, and if someone stumbles onto it, at least they'll get a chuckle out of it. Let’s hope no one finds it, but if they do, it’s ready to greet them with a smile.</p><p>And then there’s the <strong>navbar</strong>. Oh, my beloved navbar. For a while there, again, it just disappeared. Just like that. Gone. <b>Vanished into the ether</b>, leaving me scratching my head again and feeling like I’d lost my compass. But after some <b>div-juggling </b>and what felt like a wild goose chase, we managed to bring it back to life. And I couldn't help but feel that metaphor <b>coming full circle</b>: it’s like the foundation of the project. The smallest, most subtle detail—easy to overlook—but without it, the whole structure falters.</p><p>I’m learning so much about what it means to bring a project like this to life. It’s not just the code, though there’s plenty of that. It’s the vision, the passion to <b>make something from scratch</b>, and the joy (and frustration) of watching it evolve into something real.</p><p>And now, as the project stands on the edge of being tested by real people (gulp), I realize just how much it’s become a part of me. <b>It’s not just another website</b>—it’s the product of months of problem-solving, dreaming, and (let’s be honest) battling a bit with CSS. But here we are, <b><em>almost</em> ready </b>for the big reveal.</p><p>As the site continues to grow into what I’ve envisioned, there’s still plenty to polish. But at this point, I’ve found the magic in embracing the imperfections—because that’s where the growth happens. And hey, it’s not just me that sees this. Soon, others will see it too, and they’ll know it’s not <b>just a figment of my imagination</b>. This thing <em>really</em> exists.</p><p><b>Time to make it official</b>.</p><p>Until the next milestone, let’s keep building, tweaking, and embracing all the crazy, messy, exciting moments that come with creating something from scratch.

Today, I got up close and personal with that last 5% of my project: the fine-tuning, debugging, and all the little details that make the difference between “good enough” and “ready for launch.”</span><br></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;""><span style=""font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"">The Power of Polishing Code</span><span style=""font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;""> One thing I’ve come to understand is that “polished code” isn’t just about functionality - it’s about professionalism. It’s not enough for the site to work; it has to be clean and easy for others to understand. That’s where refining your comments and code comes in. I had to revisit some of my old comments today, especially where things felt cluttered or out of place. Comments are there to guide, not confuse.</span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;""><span style=""font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"">I noticed a few of my comments were more like personal notes - useful for me but potentially confusing to someone else. Today, I cleaned up my explanations, making sure they aligned with a more professional standard. The result? A much neater project that would be easier for any other developer to pick up.</span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;""><span style=""font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"">Solving the Mysteries of HTML and Django Templates</span><span style=""font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;""> It wasn’t all about cleaning up comments, though. There was also a pesky bug in my Django template that was affecting the comments section display. Honestly, it was driving me mad! The comments were either stacked weirdly or not appearing as they should. It turns out, an extra </span><span style=""font-size:11pt;font-family:'Roboto Mono',monospace;color:#188038;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"">&lt;div&gt;</span><span style=""font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;""> had snuck in there.

But every time you find the culprit - whether it’s an extra line of code or a formatting glitch - it’s a win. It’s the small victories like these that remind you of the progress you're making, even when it feels like you’re chasing tiny details.</span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;""><span style=""font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"">The Importance of Professionalism</span><span style=""font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;""> What’s clear is that even though I’m still learning, I want my work to reflect a professional level of care and attention. Today, I got that much closer to launch by focusing on the details that matter - both in code and in presentation. It’s easy to get excited about big milestones, but it’s the small, sometimes tedious work that makes everything feel solid.</span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;""><span style=""font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"">And now, knowing my comments and templates are refined and polished, I’m just about ready to hit that “launch” button.</span></p><p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-73f01bc7-7fff-3255-c44e-2eb3238ce5eb""><br></span></p>",,2024-10-15 22:31:34.518876+00:00,2024-10-26 13:20:29.738372+00:00,1,2024-10-15 22:31:28+00:00,anotherlaura,21,,
How Collaboration Boosts Confidence: Trusting the Process and Overcoming Impostor Syndrome,how-collaboration-boosts-confidence-trusting-the-process-and-overcoming-impostor-syndrome,ljtalks,https://res.cloudinary.com/dcvata7jw/image/upload/v1729031037/yeiuy839dsp0z1kk3vov.jpg,,,"<p>As a freelancer, it can be especially tough when you feel like you're walking that very fine line between what <b>you know </b>and what <b>you know you don’t know</b>.&nbsp;</p><p>Sit on that for a moment... It's where I live right now; my eyes have been opened to so much in the last few months. I *<b>know</b>* there is so much still to learn.&nbsp;</p><p>One of my tutors said something that stuck so hard and made so much sense. ""<b>We're problem solvers</b>. If you've got a passenger in the taxi you're driving, and he wants to go to a city... Break it down into manageable chunks; Just by knowing that you're not too far from London, you know the problem can be solved. You don't need to know the exact route, the problem becomes easier just by knowing London exists...""</p><p>It’s like the difference between traveling with a GPS today and navigating with an old-school map a few years ago. Back then, I’d plot my route using key cities and junctions to guide me. I never needed to know every street name - I just needed to trust that the path was there and I’d get where I needed to go.</p><p>Development feels a lot like that. You don’t need to have the full solution mapped out; you just need to know that a solution <em>exists</em>. It’s like trying to solve a puzzle - you don’t always see the entire picture, but you know the pieces are there.</p><p>So when you hit a roadblock, you’re not standing there lost. It’s more like knowing you have the right tools in your kit - you might not know exactly how they fit together, but you know they’ll get you where you need to go. It’s all about using what you have to keep moving forward, even if the path isn’t fully clear yet.</p><p>There's always the worry - will clients trust me with their projects if they sense my inexperience?<br></p><p>That feeling has lingered for me, but today was a reminder that <b>the gaps in experience </b>can be bridged with <b>passion, persistence, and a willingness to learn</b>.<br></p><p>This journey of <b>building my website </b>has been proof of that. </p><p>I didn’t just grab a template and call it a day. </p><p>I sat down, worked out <b>exactly what I wanted this site to do</b>, and learned how to <b>bring all the parts together</b>. Along the way, I’ve cried into my coffee, worked late into the night, had a fair few 3am starts, and regularly questioned whether I could pull it off. </p><p>Yet, here I am, standing on the brink of <b>something I’m truly proud of</b>.</p><p>What makes today significant is that I hit a wall with my project’s formatting. The comments section wasn’t behaving as it should, and for way too long I was scratching my head just willing things to work! After way too long trying to figure it out alone, I threw it out there and&nbsp;asked for help. </p><p>Old Laura might have stewed in silence forever, and maybe got distracted by something more shiny and exciting to focus on, but I'm focused on getting goals properly ticked off now, and sometimes you need to try something different. So I asked for help.</p><p><strong>Trusting the Process</strong></p><p>This is a key part of being a developer. Not having all the answers immediately doesn’t mean I’m not capable. When I reached out for help, not only was the problem fixed swiftly, but my confidence got a boost too. Often the solution really isn’t far off, and getting confirmation or guidance from someone else can be the difference between never ending frustration and instant clarity.</p><p>Collaborating with someone who understands the problem brought me <b>out of my head </b>and <b>back into flow</b>. Things started to click again, and that’s when I realised - asking for help isn’t a weakness. It’s part of growing, part of getting so much better, faster.</p><p><strong>Overcoming Impostor Syndrome</strong></p><p>Impostor syndrome is something I <b>wrestle with constantly</b>. As a freelancer, there’s always that fear that I’ll be seen as someone who doesn’t know enough. But today, I recognised that asking for help and collaborating isn’t a sign of weakness. It’s a sign of learning and growth.</p><p>Perfection is a tricky thing. Let's be honest, we all want it, but it takes time. Development is about figuring things out, and sometimes the best progress comes from learning on the go. I’m embracing the fact that I don’t have to know everything right away. But I’m eager to learn, to figure things out myself, and to ask for help when it gets beyond me: just keep pushing forward.</p><p><b>This project </b>-&nbsp;my website - is a symbol of that. It’s not just a site I <b>built from scratch (</b>with so much help from tutorials, mentors, and a lot of coffee-fuelled nights); it’s a reflection of <b>how far I’ve come</b>. Ten weeks ago, I didn’t even know what a “back end” was, and now I’m like the wizard behind the curtain, <b>making all the magic </b>happen.</p><p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-a50d3569-7fff-8d63-fc0b-9546de90ac16""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">For those of you checking every line of my code, I see you.

Today marks the official end of my 16-week whirlwind course, and let me tell you, it has been the craziest, most transformative time of my life. And that’s no exaggeration.</span><br></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;""><span style=""font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"">How did it all start? Well, like many great stories, it began by accident. I was just trying to learn some basic HTML and CSS so I could create a little website—</span><span style=""font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:italic;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"">a simple blog</span><span style=""font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"">, or so I thought. Then I stumbled upon this course, which required a short five-day challenge as a taster. I signed up thinking, “Five days? Sure, why not?” I couldn’t put it down. By Sunday afternoon, I’d finished it.</span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;""><span style=""font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"">That’s when things got serious. I was accepted onto the course, and I could </span><span style=""font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:italic;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"">not wait</span><span style=""font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"">. Day one was gentle enough, easing me in. But it was sneaky—because by day three, I was hooked, neck-deep in code, and there was no turning back. The excitement kept building. They talked a lot about self-care and learning curves, and oh, they were right about that </span><span style=""font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:italic;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"">curve</span><span style=""font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"">. There’s this bit where you feel like you’re falling off the edge of the world, and then, out of nowhere, you make a massive discovery. It’s like magic. And it happens just as you’re about to give up.</span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;""><span style=""font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"">This wasn’t just a solo ride either. My teamies were right there with me, going through the same rollercoaster of emotions. We were like a bunch of kids standing in line for a wild ride we knew was going to be intense but so worth it. And when you reach the end, you’re filled with pride, thinking, “Wowzers!

Our cohort leaders were friendly, knowledgeable, and always there with a little nugget of wisdom to pull us back from the edge when we were drowning in errors. I’m really going to miss that environment—the camaraderie, the cheering each other on, the celebrations when someone finally squashes that bug that’s been haunting them for hours.</span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;""><span style=""font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"">I thrived in that space, and I realized something important about myself: I love helping others. But not in a “here’s the answer” kind of way. It’s about supporting someone while they work things out, reminding them that the power to solve problems is already within them. They just need to be brave enough to break things, so they can have those breakthrough moments.

It was about collaborating in a fully remote environment, learning how to give and receive feedback, and realizing how crucial it is to stay connected. It was about picking each other up, leaning on each other when we needed it, and celebrating every little win along the way.</span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;""><span style=""font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"">And deadlines.
